# PRODIGY_CS_02
# Simple Image Encryption Tool

This Python script provides a basic image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation. The encryption is achieved by applying an XOR operation on the pixel values of an image, and the same process is reversed for decryption.

## Features

- **Encrypt images** by modifying pixel values using XOR.
- **Decrypt images** by reversing the encryption using the same key.
- Supports PNG images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) library for image processing.
